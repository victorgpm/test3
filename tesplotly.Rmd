## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
x <- read.csv("inflasi_yoytes.csv")
fore <- read.csv("inflasi_fore.csv")

m <- x[which.max(x$Dates), ]
a <- list(x = m$Dates, y = m$fit, text = ~paste(m$Dates, ': ', m$fit), xref = "x", yref = "y", showarrow = TRUE, arrowhead = 7, ax = 20, ay = -40)

p <- plot_ly() %>%
  add_lines(x = x$Dates, y = x$fit, type = 'scatter', mode = 'ribbons', color = I("black"), name = "observed") %>%
  layout(annotations = a) %>%
  add_ribbons(x = fore$Dates, ymin = fore$lwr, ymax = fore$upr, color = I("gray95"), name = "95% confidence") %>%
  add_lines(x = fore$Dates, y = fore$fit, color = I("blue"), name = "prediction") %>%
layout(title = "Inflasi", xaxis = list(rangeslider = list(type = "date"), dtick = 10), yaxis = list(title = "Inflasi"))


p
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
